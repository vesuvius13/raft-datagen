## About RAFT
RAFT (Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning) is a methodology for adapting language models to domain-specific Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). This app implements the RAFT data generation process to create high-quality training data from PDF documents.
### Features

1. PDF Processing: Convert PDFs to text using GPT-4o vision capabilities
2. Document Chunking: Split documents into meaningful segments for question generation
3. Training Data Generation: Create question-answer pairs with oracle and distractor documents
4. Customizable Parameters: Adjust all aspects of the RAFT process
5. Dataset Export: Download your datasets in JSONL format ready for fine-tuning

### Installation
Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raft-datagen.git
cd raft-datagen
```
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For PDF to image conversion, you'll need to install poppler:
```
On Linux: sudo apt-get install -y poppler-utils
On Mac: brew install poppler`
On Windows: conda install -c conda-forge poppler
```
Usage
Run the Streamlit app:
`streamlit run streamlit_app.py`

The app will open in your browser.

1) Enter your OpenAI API key
2) Upload a PDF document
3) Configure RAFT parameters
4) Click "Process PDF and Generate Training Data"
5) Download the generated datasets
